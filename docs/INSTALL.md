## Installation

Fork this repository (Click the Fork button in the top right of this page, click your Profile Image)
Clone your fork down to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenUBA.git
```

1. Install pip3 if you don't have it already
```    
    curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"
    python3 get-pip.py     
    sudo python3 get-pip.py
```
2. Install the python dependencies and execute the makefile
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
make
```
3. Install HADOOP and JDK
4. Configure Spark environment by running spark_env.sh
```
bash spark_env.sh
OR
./spark_env.sh
```

5. Run the API server (from root directory)
```
make
```
This will invoke the "dev" stage of the Makefile, thus running the mypy linter for syntax checking, and the core.py

### if you have another python execute
you may need to alter the "run" stage of the Makefile, similar to:
```
cd core/ ; python3.7 core.py ;
```

To verify this is working, try to access
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/display/teststring
```

6. Run the web server (from root directory)
```
make run_ui
```
7. Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to view the web app running
